            The GT2 European Series (formerly the GT Sports Club and Blancpain GT Sports Club),
             organized by SRO Motorsports Group, is an auto racing series for the SRO GT2 class of grand tourer cars,
              designed for amateur pay drivers in the FIA Bronze category. This target audience is also known in sportscar
               as "gentleman drivers".
               The GT Sports Club Europe series was fully suspended in 2020 as a consequence of the global COVID-19 pandemic,
                and thus no GT2-class competition was held in 2020. The GT2 series was re-established in a significantly different
                 format in 2021, adding a Pro-Am style subclass and Fanatec as the title sponsor; this Fanatec GT2 European Series
                     continued in 2022.
                     The 2021-onwards GT2 series runs in support of the GT World Challenge Europe weekends and includes Friday practice
                      and qualifying with one race each on Saturday and Sunday.
                      The inaugural Blancpain GT Sports Club series in 2015 was aimed at amateur pay drivers,
                       with competition limited to drivers of a grade similar to the FIA Bronze category at the time,
                        and with cars homologated in a number of ways and open to running older chassis. By the end of 2019
                         it was possible to use any of: FIA GT3 for that season, re-homologated cars from earlier GT3 generations,
                          RACB G3 cars, GTE-spec cars, and Renault Sport Trophy cars, all competing in a single class through
                           a Balance of Performance process and additional Cup Trophys based on driver age or car subclass.
                            In the early seasons Bronze included subcategories Titanium for drivers aged 50-59 and Iron for
                             drivers over 60 years of age; these subcategories are not in use in 2022.
                             The Sports Club raceday design was originally focused on running lunchtime-to-lunchtime
                              to ease weekend travel and encourage "arrive and drive" entries, with free practice and qualifying
                               sessions on day one, followed by qualifying and main races the following day. GT Sports Club Europe
                                was suspended in 2020 as a consequence of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The "GT Sports Club"
                                 concept was relaunched in 2021 as an umbrella covering a championship built on an also new GT2 class;
                                  a sister GT3-only championship with a similar approach as before to running multiple generations
                                   of GT3 together; and a non-competitive "GT1 Sports Club" aimed at bringing road-going supercars
                                    on track together. These series now support the GT World Challenge Europe calendar.
