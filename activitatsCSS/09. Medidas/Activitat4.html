        The power a Formula One engine produces is generated by operating at a very high rotational speed,
         up to <strong class="subrayat">20,000 revolutions per minute (rpm)</strong>. However, they are electronically limited to 15,000 as
          of the 2014 season. This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size, which typically
           operate at less than <strong class="subrayat"> 6,000 rpm</strong>. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One
            engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Ford Cosworth DFV and the mean effective
             pressure had stayed at around 14 bar. Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around
              12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate
               the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power required
                to drive the camshaft and the valves to the point where the loss nearly offset the power gain through
                 the increase in rpm. They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault in 1986, which
                  inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have an extremely high spring
                  
                   rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes,
                    thus lowering the overall power loss. Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers have used
                     pneumatic valve springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over <strong class="subrayat">20,000 rpm</strong>.
