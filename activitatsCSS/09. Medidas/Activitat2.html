        <p> Group GT3, known technically as Cup Grand Touring Cars and commonly referred to as simply GT3,
            is a set of regulations maintained by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) for
             grand tourer racing cars designed for use in various auto racing series throughout the world.
              The GT3 category was initially created in 2005 by the SRO Group as a third rung in the ladder
               of grand touring motorsport, below the Group GT1 and Group GT2 categories which were utilized
                in the SRO's FIA GT Championship, and launched its own series in 2006 called the FIA GT3 European Championship.
                 Since then, Group GT3 has expanded to become the de facto category for many national and international
                  grand touring series, although some series modify the ruleset from the FIA standard.
                   By 2013, nearly 20 automobile manufacturers have built or been represented with GT3 machines.</p>

        <p> Group GT3 allows for a wide variety of car types to be homologated with almost no limit on engine sizes
            and configurations or chassis construction or layout. GT3 cars must be based on mass production road
             car models that are being built and sold at the time of homologation. Performance of all the Group GT3
              cars are regulated, either by the GT Bureau of the FIA or by a series' specific ruling body,
               through Balance of Performance formulae that adjusts limits on horsepower, weight, engine management,
                and aerodynamics to prevent a single manufacturer from becoming dominant in the class.
                 The cars in GT3 are designed to have a weight between 1200 kg and 1300 kg (2645 lbs and 2866 lbs)
                  with horsepower between 500 hp and 600 hp. All cars have a very similar power to weight ratio but
                   achieved either by high power and high weight such as the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG or low power and low weight
                    such as the Porsche 911 GT3. GT3 cars also have traction control, ABS, and built-in air
                     jacks for quick pit stops.
